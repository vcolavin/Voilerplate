# vplate
CSS styles I find myself using often. Mobile-first, responsive, namespaced, attemps to be minimal, and modular.

Even if I don't use this actual code for new projects, it's certainly a useful reference.

index.html includes examples of all styles defined in vplate.css.

Includes:
- a sticky footer that works
- a boring but functional header
- mobile-responsive menu items (WIP)
- unordered lists which conform to a grid

Uses [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and [hipster ipsum](http://hipsum.co/).
