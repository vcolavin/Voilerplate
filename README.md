# Voilerplate
Boilerplate HTML + CSS stuff I'll end up using for most sites.

Uses normalize.css and is bootstrapped for a mobile-first approach.

Also includes styles for elements I like, e.g.
- header
- a sticky footer that works
- mobile-responsive menu items
- unordered lists which conform to a grid
