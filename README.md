# Voilerplate
Boilerplate HTML + CSS stuff I find myself using often.

Uses normalize.css and is bootstrapped for a mobile-first approach.

index.html includes examples of all styles defined in vplate_styles.css

Also includes styles for elements I like, e.g.
- header
- a sticky footer that works
- mobile-responsive menu items
- unordered lists which conform to a grid
