# Voilerplate
Boilerplate HTML + CSS stuff I find myself using often.

Uses normalize.css and is bootstrapped for a mobile-first approach.

index.html includes examples of all styles defined in vplate_styles.css

Cool things included:
- header
- a sticky footer that works
- mobile-responsive menu items
- unordered lists which conform to a grid

Uses [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and [hipster ipsum](http://hipsum.co/).
