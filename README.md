# Voilerplate
Boilerplate HTML + CSS stuff I find myself using often. Mobile-first, responsive.

Even if I don't use this actual code for new projects, it's certainly a useful reference.

index.html includes examples of all styles defined in vplate_styles.css

Cool things included:
- a sticky footer that works
- mobile-responsive menu items
- unordered lists which conform to a grid

Uses [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and [hipster ipsum](http://hipsum.co/).
